=== 6.1 Skaffold

**Slides**

**Code**

https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold[Skaffold] is a command line utility that facilitates continuous development for Kubernetes applications. With Skaffold, you can iterate on your application source code locally then deploy it to a remote Kubernetes cluster.

. Check context:

	kubectl config get-contexts
	CURRENT   NAME                                  CLUSTER                          AUTHINFO                              NAMESPACE
	*         arun@k8s-course.us-west-2.eksctl.io   k8s-course.us-west-2.eksctl.io   arun@k8s-course.us-west-2.eksctl.io   
	          docker-for-desktop                    docker-for-desktop-cluster       docker-for-desktop                    
	          minikube                              minikube                         minikube 

. Change to local Kubernetes cluster:

	kubectl config use-context docker-for-desktop

. Check if service is running:

	kubectl get svc,deployment,pod

. Check Helm applications:

	helm ls

. Delete Helm chart:

	helm delete myapp --purge

    #helm v3
	helm uninstall myapp

. Download Skaffold:

	brew install skaffold

. Copy `manifests/standalone/greeting.yaml` to `app` directory
. Change to `app` directory
. Show `skaffold.yaml`
. Open http://localhost:8080/hello in browser. This will show that the page is not available.
. Run Skaffold in the application directory:

    skaffold dev

. Refresh the page in browser to see the output.

. Remove the Skaffold resources from the application directory:

    skaffold delete

Same Java application, now continuously built through Skaffold and deployed to a local Kubernetes cluster. This can also be integrated with Jib. This can also be deployed to a remote Kubernetes cluster.

=== 6.2 AWS CodePipeline

**Slides**

. Code Pipeline + Code Commit
.. Key benefits
.. Workflow

**Code**

. Set up context:

	kubectl config set-context arun@k8s-course.us-west-2.eksctl.io

. Show and explain `buildspec.yaml`
. Show https://eksworkshop.com/codepipeline/
. Create IAM role
. Modify aws-auth ConfigMap
. Talk about GitHub access token
. Create CodePipeline
.. Change the region to `us-west-2`
.. Specify GitHub user name and token
.. Change the repo
.. Change EKS cluster name
.. Show CloudFormation
. https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines[Show CodePipline]
. Tail logs
. Use the following command to access the service:

    curl http://$(kubectl get svc/greeting \
      -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'):8080/hello

Same Java application, now continuously built through AWS CodePipeline and deployed to an Amazon EKS cluster.
